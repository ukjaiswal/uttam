# PPP/Dialup days
Before the dawn of Broadband for internet connection, PPP using dialup connection was the only option and yes, it was costly. Few of the scripts used that point of time is documented below.

## Fetchmail when PPP active

```
#!/bin/sh
# This script will check the status of net connectivity and will fetchmails.
if `/sbin/route -n|grep ppp0 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null`; then
/usr/bin/fetchmail
fi
exit 0
```
